just walked out still can smell the butter popcorn, or is it my shirt? god. this entire movie feels like a leaky faucet... drip, drip, emotional cascade, dizzy almost. when life gives you tangerines is like holding a bowl of oranges thinking they’re lemons until they smile back at you. do tangerines smile? they do now. i dont think i’ve ever seen oranges dance but here they were, intertwined with this weird plot about family and bees. why bees?? is life a beehive? noisy like the theater. buzzing with thoughts. 

> oh right i forgot to put my phone on silent. anyway, there’s this scene, god, my back kept screeching for relief like a rusty pipe about to burst but the dialogue, it spoke to me, almost whispered like thinking of something while your tools trip from your hand and bounce... that moment when the dad and the daughter reconcile, it felt like unclogging a drain—everything finally rushes through. cathartic relief. where’s my wrench. but just as suddenly, splat, a drop of soda sticky against my sole. 

someone should download the movie, keep it forever... it invades your sensory system. that kid actor, the way they looked at the sunset was a puzzle piece that fit but was from a different set, a sunset shaped donut? confusion as cuisine. the awkward way the brother kept mentioning buckets when really I think he meant it as a metaphor for life’s downpour, or a bad plumbing job? he said something like fill your bucket with honey, not the drips from the leak. 

whatcha gonna do, huh? watch the movie, see for yourself. my notes are a scrawled mess like cheese on dry wall. i think someone is singing in the alley.

no internet, tape rewinding sound in my head {
    int incompleteThoughts = 42;
    bool finalThought = GetPostMovieMood();
}
